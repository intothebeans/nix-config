# NixOS is Awesome

My config certainly isn't as complex as some others out there (mad respect), but that doesn't make me any less proud or excited about it. I currently have only one machine, my personal laptop, with one user, me. Most things are configured using home manager following the principle of least privelage. I appreciate feedback or suggestions!
